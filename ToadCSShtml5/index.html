    <p>I have always loved taking care and tending to Toads, Frogs and other animals. But right mow i am going to talk to you about toads!</p>
    <hr>
    <p>Toads are Amphibians which means they spend their lives in water and on land. They can go in between but they mostly stay on land as they can't breath underwater.</p>

    <p> Toads are also known for being fat, and chunky and having a very large appatite. They can and will eat anything that moves, and they aren't really the best on thinking it through.</p>
