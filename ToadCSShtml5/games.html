    <p>Deep Rock Galactic is one of my favorite video games, as i have spent plenty of time on the game mad by a small studio called Ghost Ship Games, located in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

<h2> Other games I like and why i Personally love playing Deep Rock Galactic.</h2>
<p>Lets start with some basics alright?</p>
<ul>
    Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player co-op first person shooter, where you play as a dwarf miner, whether that be a gunner with a minigun, Autocannon, or Rocket launcher, a War crime Driller who can use a flamethrower, a freeze gun, or straight up just acid, also he has a c4 which is used to blow anything up. A scout who dies 24/7, has a grappeling hook as a travel tool and uses wierd weapons like a rifle, an m1 grand, or a plasma rifle, which all need to be buffed in my eyes. And finally the engineer or the cheese gun man, with turrets, a platform gun whicch shoots something that looks like cheese and weapons like a shotgun, an electric smg, and an aimbot smg-rifle which locks on and bullies anything it hits.

    <h3> So why the glaze?</h3>
    <p>The game is overall just good and fun to play. You can customize the game with mods on steam and play with your friends and friendly fire them if you want.</p>
    <p>However the game gets difficult the more you increase the difficulty so in which higher hazards, which just a harder mission = death easier.</p>
    <p> although the game is hard, you're rewarded through credits in which you can spend them on weapon upgrades and equipment, and yes on drinks at a full liquor bar whihc is served cold by your robot assistant bosco, at least im pretty sure it's him, or maybe a look a like.</P>
