    <hr>
    <p>Deep Rock Galactic is one of my favorite video games, as i have spent plenty of time on the game mad by a small studio called Ghost Ship Games, located in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>

<h2> Other games I like and why i Personally love playing Deep Rock Galactic.</h2>
<p>Lets start with some basics alright?</p>
    Deep Rock Galactic is a 1-4 player co-op first person shooter, where you play as a dwarf miner, whether that be a gunner with a minigun, Autocannon, or Rocket launcher, a War crime Driller who can use a flamethrower, a freeze gun, or straight up just acid, also he has a c4 which is used to blow anything up. A scout who dies 24/7, has a grappeling hook as a travel tool and uses wierd weapons like a rifle, an m1 grand, or a plasma rifle, which all need to be buffed in my eyes. And finally the engineer or the cheese gun man, with turrets, a platform gun whicch shoots something that looks like cheese and weapons like a shotgun, an electric smg, and an aimbot smg-rifle which locks on and bullies anything it hits.

    <h3> So why the glaze?</h3>
    <p>The game is overall just good and fun to play. You can customize the game with mods on steam and play with your friends and friendly fire them if you want.</p>
    <p>However the game gets difficult the more you increase the difficulty so in which higher hazards, which just a harder mission = death easier.</p>
    <p> although the game is hard, you're rewarded through credits in which you can spend them on weapon upgrades and equipment, and yes on drinks at a full liquor bar whihc is served cold by your robot assistant bosco, at least im pretty sure it's him, or maybe a look a like.</P>

<h3>So what other games do I like?</h3>
<p> Oh boy I just started playing this game and even the devs who created deep rock like this game.</p>
<h2>This game is called Hell divers 2!</h2>

<h1>When I tell you this game is both fun and incredibely difficult, i mean it...</h1>
<P> Hell divers is one of those games where if you turn around and see nothing it doesn't mean your safe. It just means your probally not looking hard enough until 50 enemies jump you and pack you up real quick.</P>
<P> you will be bullied relentleslly, like im telling you if you aren't shooting enimies whether they are the automations which is just skynet, illuminoids whihc are just aliens on salts, or bugs which are insanely fast and armored. you are gonna die. </P>
<h2>Heres how the game works.</h2>
<P> You drop into a planet literally from space by a bullet in whihc you are in and instantly start preparing to fight your wya through all sorts of enemies to get to your objective.</P>
<p> you have a loadout which is just your weapons you spawn in with and have all thorugh the game, unless you swap in the game with another primary weapon.</p>
<p> You have these things called strategems, which are these sort of cheat codes you use to call in things liek supply drops, different support weapons, mechs, vehicles, and of course the 500kg eagle bomb, and the rail cannon.</p>
<p> simillar to deep rock, you have perks, you have to fight waves of enemies, and you will be bullied by heavily armored enimies and bugs.</p>
<footer>These are just 2 of my favorite games as I have plenty of more, it's just i dont have the time to explain them right now. Anyways, I hope i made a good representation of myself and what my hobbies and some of my favorite games are. As i enjoy peak games and talking about them, and enjoy having pet toads that don't cry or complain about anyyhign. As i said it, nice metting you, have a great day and take care.</footer>
